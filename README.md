# Tech Sector Layoffs: A Tableau Story

## Overview

This GitHub repository houses a Tableau story that visualizes the recent trends of hiring and layoffs within the tech sector, highlighting the significant impact of the pandemic and macroeconomic factors on this industry. Through a series of visualizations, we dive into the dynamics of tech sector employment, exploring the causes and effects of layoffs and hiring booms, and their correlation with broader economic indicators.

## Abstract

In recent years, the tech sector has seen dramatic fluctuations in employment, with significant hiring surges and layoffs. The pandemic period notably allowed technology companies to thrive, expanding the gap between tech and other sectors. This project seeks to understand the magnitude and implications of tech sector layoffs by analyzing trends, contributing factors, and subsequent effects through comprehensive visualizations. By incorporating historical data on federal funds rates and stock prices, the analysis examines the macroeconomic influences on layoffs. Our findings suggest that the majority of tech layoffs occurred in the United States, with a notable increase from April 2022, correlating with wider vaccine availability and rising interest rates. The consumer tech sector experienced the most layoffs, whereas the media sector saw the fewest relative to funding received. Increases in the federal fund rate often preceded layoffs, while stock prices tended to rise post-layoff.
